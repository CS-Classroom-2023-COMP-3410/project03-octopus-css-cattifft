This project was more challenging than I thought. It is easy to find things in the HTML organization, but I did not anticipate having to make so many seperate items in my CSS file. I think I could have organized this better by starting with the big picture things instead of focusing on one div at a time. It was also difficult to describe exactly what I needed in ChatGPT since it is visual information. 

It did get easier by the end but not everything is exactly as it is in the photo. The biggest difference is in the Octopus Quiz box. I know it has to do with the box structure of the element, so I did try to mess with it a little. 

For each div, I started with general spacing and padding, text-size, and color. Then I looked at specific issues like the bullet points or highlight by asking ChatGPT how to change them and looking in the HTML to find the best way to select them. I looked at the page altogether to make general cohesive changes.
